# Teabag-Shooter
A small Man shoots Teabags to destroy Dalek-bins and Bigmouth Billy Bass wearing a Santa Hat.

This is a C# game made using the Unity3D engine a few years ago. I made this as a first project to understand the game engine and the C# language. It was mostly cobbled together from various pre-written scripts by others.

It contains music which I composed and produced specially for the game. If you would like to hear more of my compositions, I have an album out called 'Reflection in Time' and I have a soundlcoud account. For more information visit my personal website.

This project requires that you have Unity3D installed in order to compile it.
